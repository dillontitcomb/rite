						ABOUT RITE EDITIONS
					</p>
					<p>
						Steven Leiber and Robin Wright founded RITE Editions in 2007 in San
						Francisco with the intent of commissioning artists to make limited
						edition publications.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Since its inception, RITE Editions has published 28 editions. The
						inaugural edition (in 2007) was "Sound of Music, A Record of the
						Sound of Its Own Making" by Jonathan Monk, an LP recording
						referencing Robert Morris’s "Box with the Sound of Its Own Making"
						(1961). Subsequent publications include Paul Sietsema’s "At the hour
						of tea" (2014) Margo Wolowiec’s "Blanket" (2017), "Steven Leiber Catalogs"
						(2019), Woody De Othello’s "Jigsaw Puzzle" (2020-21), and Ruth Laskey’s
						artist’s book Twill Series in 2021. In 2022-23, RE will add 5 new
						editions to the list: Dawn Cerny’s Tabletop Sculptures or Holders, a
						multiple and publication, Toyin Ojih Odutola's Artist’s Book,
						"Satellite", Gabriel Sierra’s limited edition, "The Fingerprints of
						Bruce Nauman", a book exploring Cecilia Vicuña’s Palabrarmas, entitled 
						"Word Weapons" and Carissa Potter's "How to Breathe Under Water," Book and Kit Edition.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Every RITE Editions is produced in close collaboration with each
						respective artist, and is distinguished by its conceptual nature and
						high production values. Containers, packaging, and mailers have also
						been developed in great detail in collaboration with the artists. A
						variety of mediums are explored in RITE Editions publications. And
						notably, all editions are intimate and interactive and necessitate
						close examination.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Steven Leiber passed away in 2012. RITE Editions published Artists &
						Editions in 2013 as a tribute to Steven and his work as a dealer,
						collector, and teacher. Fourteen artists, many of whom engaged in an
						ongoing dialogue with Steven during his lifetime, contributed
						extraordinary works to the edition. (For more information, see the
						publication in the RE EDITIONS section.)
